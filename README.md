# Laboratory 1

## 1.1 Frequency Resolution üìè
In this task, we created a signal `y` consisting of two sinusoids at frequencies of 30 Hz and 30.5 Hz. We then calculated the Fourier Transform of the signal using FFT and plotted its amplitude-frequency spectrum. The task involved analyzing the relationship between signal length and frequency resolution by adjusting the signal length until both frequency components were clearly distinguishable. 

## 1.2 Spectral Leakage and Windowing ü™ü
We created a signal consisting of a 7 Hz sine wave and a 20 Hz cosine wave. We calculated the Fourier Transform of this signal and analyzed the spectrum using a logarithmic scale. The task also included exploring the effects of changing the number of samples on spectral leakage. We applied a Hanning window to the signal to reduce spectral leakage and compared the resulting frequency spectrum with the original signal.

## 1.3 Sampling Frequency Change üìâ
Here, we created a signal consisting of two cosines at frequencies of 125 Hz and 375 Hz and explored the effect of downsampling the signal by keeping every second sample. We compared the frequency spectra and time-domain signals of the original and downsampled signals, and analyzed the impact of downsampling on the frequency spectrum and resolution.

# Laboratory 2 üé∂

## 1. Signal Correlation üì°

### 1.1 Signal Generation and Correlation
In this task, we created a signal `y` with a sampling frequency of 2000 Hz and a length of 2000 samples. An empty signal vector was initialized, followed by the creation of a second chirp signal `yp` with a frequency range from 10 Hz to 300 Hz. The chirp signal was multiplied by a Hanning window of the same length. The signal `yp` was added to `y` starting from the 500th sample. Next, we calculated the correlation between `y` and `yp` using the `correlate` function and plotted the results in the time domain. We also compared the results using the convolution function (`convolve`) and discussed the differences in their implementation.

### 1.2 Correlation with Varying Parameters
We performed correlation on signals with different frequency parameters:
- The length of `yp` was 200 samples with different values for `f2` (100 Hz, 200 Hz, 500 Hz) while `f1` remained 30 Hz.
- The second set of tests used `f1 = 500 Hz` and `f2 = 500 Hz`.

We plotted the correlation results for each combination and analyzed the relationship between the time width of the correlation result and the frequency bandwidth of the signal `yp`.

### 1.3 Impulse Detection in Signal with Multiple Instances
We added a signal `yp` with a length of 1000 samples (starting at 500th and 750th samples with amplitudes of 1 and 0.5, respectively) to `y`. We then calculated the correlation between the newly created signal `y` and `yp` and analyzed the detected impulses. We calculated the time intervals between the impulses and discussed how their locations relate to the positions of `yp` within `y`.

### 1.4 Signal Correlation with Noise üå´Ô∏è
We added white noise with varying standard deviations (0.5, 1, and 2) to the signal `y` created in task 1.3. We performed correlation between the noisy signal and `yp`, and plotted the results in the time domain for each noise level. The task involved analyzing how noise levels affected the visibility of correlation peaks in the signal.

## 2. Matched Filtering üéØ

### 2.1 Signal Detection in Audio Recording
In this task, we analyzed an audio recording containing synthetic signals in both channels with increasing frequencies. The goal was to locate the impulses within the audio recording. The reference impulse was provided in the file `pulse.csv`. The audio to analyze is provided in the file `audio.wav`. Using matched filtering, we detected the impulses and identified the exact locations and channels where the signal appeared.

### 2.2 Frequency Domain Signal Processing
We repeated the analysis from task 2.1 in the frequency domain. We performed the conjugate multiplication of the Fourier transform of the reference pulse `ypf` and the Fourier transform of the audio signal `yf`. Zero-padding was applied to the pulse signal to match the length of the audio signal's Fourier transform. We then used the inverse FFT (`ifft`) to compute the correlation in the time domain and compared the results with the time-domain correlation. The task involved visualizing the time-domain signals, comparing them with the frequency-domain filtering, and discussing the results.

# Laboratory 3 ‚ö° RLC Circuit Analysis

## 1. RLC Circuit Modeling and Frequency Response üìà

### 1.1 Impulse Response of the RLC Circuit  
We modeled an RLC circuit using its transfer function based on Kirchhoff's laws.  
The impulse response of the system was calculated analytically in the time domain using the `forced_response` function.  
System parameters: \( R = 10 Ohm), \( C = 1\*10^-6 F), \( L = 4\*10-6 H).

### 1.2 Bode Plot and Damping Estimation  
The Bode plot of the system was obtained using the Fourier transform of the impulse response and compared with the theoretical plot from the transfer function.  
The damping coefficient was estimated using two methods: logarithmic decrement and half-power bandwidth.  
The system behavior (underdamped, critically damped, or overdamped) was determined based on the value of \( \xi \).

### 1.3 Influence of Resistance on Damping and Bandwidth  
The Bode plot and damping coefficient were analyzed for two resistance values: \( R = 5 Ohm) and \( R = 100 Ohm).  
The relationship between resistance, damping, and bandwidth was investigated, and the approximate value of \( R \) for critical damping was determined.

## 2. Time and Frequency Domain Analysis üîÑ

### 2.1 Response to Sinusoidal Excitation and Phase Shift Calculation  
The system response to a sinusoidal input signal (amplitude 1, frequencies 70 kHz, 80 kHz, 90 kHz) was simulated.  
The amplitude of the output signal and the phase shift between input and output were measured and compared with the theoretical values from the Bode plot.

### 2.2 Convolution with Impulse Response  
The response to sinusoidal excitation was also calculated using the convolution of the input signal with the system's impulse response.  
The result was compared with the direct simulation from Task 2.1, confirming the correctness of the impulse response and the linear time-invariant (LTI) property of the system.

# Laboratory 4 ‚ö° RLC and RC Circuit Frequency Response Analysis

## 1. Frequency Response Estimation Using Chirp and Noise

### 1.1 Frequency Response from Chirp Signal üìä
Measured the input and output signals of RC and RLC filters excited by chirp signals. The frequency response was estimated using FFT-based division of the output and input spectra. Bode plots (magnitude and phase) were generated and compared with the theoretical models.

### 1.2 Corrected Theoretical Model for RLC Filter üõ†Ô∏è
To improve model accuracy, parasitic resistance of the inductor and circuit traces was introduced into the RLC transfer function. Real component values were measured with a multimeter, and inductance was estimated via curve fitting to match the empirical frequency response.

## 2. Transfer Function Estimation Using Welch Periodogram

### 2.1 Welch-Based H1 Estimator Implementation üìê
Used the `tfestimate` method (Welch periodogram) to estimate the frequency response. Applied windowing and 50% overlap to the signals to compute cross-spectral and auto-spectral densities. Estimated the H1 transfer function and compared with FFT-based result.

## 3. Frequency Response from Noise Excitation üîä

### 3.1 FFT-Based Estimation from Noise-Driven Data
Repeated the process from Task 1.1 but using white noise signals as input. Both RC and RLC filters were analyzed, and Bode plots were compared to theoretical transfer functions, including the corrected model for the RLC filter.

### 3.2 Transfer Function Estimation via `tfestimate` with Varying Resolution üéöÔ∏è
Applied the `tfestimate` function on noise-driven RC and RLC data using three different frequency resolutions (`df = 1`, `10`, `100`). The effect of changing resolution on noise, detail, and plot smoothness was analyzed. Final results were compared with theoretical models.

# Laboratory 5 üîÅ Analytical Signal & Phase Methods

## 1. Analytical Signal & Hilbert Transform üß≠

### 1.1 Properties of the Analytical Signal
Create a sinusoid `y(t)` with frequency **30 Hz**, sampling frequency **1000 Hz**, and length **N = 1000**. Obtain the analytical signal with `hilbert(y)`:
- Plot the magnitude of the **spectrum** $|FFT(y_a)|$.
- In time domain, plot **real** and **imaginary** parts of $y_a(t)$ on a single figure (two subplots).
- Read the time shift $\Delta t$ between $\Re\{y_a\}$ and $\Im\{y_a\}$ and convert it to phase:
$$
\Delta\phi = 360^\circ \cdot \frac{\Delta t}{T}.
$$

### 1.2 Custom Hilbert via FFT ‚öôÔ∏è
Re-implement the analytic signal using FFT:
1) Compute $Y=\mathrm{FFT}(y)$.  
2) Zero the **negative** frequencies (retain DC and Nyquist as per analytic construction; multiply positive bins by 2).  
3) `ifft` $\rightarrow\ y_a$.  
Compare spectrum and time plots with `scipy.signal.hilbert` and discuss differences.

## 2. Envelope & Instantaneous Frequency (Chirp) üìà

Generate a **linear chirp** `y(t) = chirp(t, F0‚ÜíF1)` with **N=2000**, **fs=2000 Hz**, **F0=5 Hz**, **F1=200 Hz**, and apply a **Hann** window.

### 2.1 Envelope & f_inst
With $y_a(t)=A(t)e^{j\theta(t)}$:
- Envelope: $A(t)=|y_a(t)|$.
- Phase (unwrap) and instantaneous frequency:
$$
f_{\text{inst}}(t)=\frac{1}{2\pi}\frac{d\theta(t)}{dt}\;\approx\; \frac{\Delta\theta}{2\pi}\, f_s.
$$
Plot $y(t)$ with $A(t)$ and plot $f_{\text{inst}}(t)$; verify the sweep vs. the designed chirp.

### 2.2 Noise Robustness üå´Ô∏è
Add white noise with $\sigma \in \{0.01, 0.1, 0.2\}$. Recompute envelope and $f_{\text{inst}}$.
Comment where errors are largest (low SNR, window edges) and why.

## 3. Phase-Shift Estimation üéõÔ∏è

### 3.1 Constant Phase Shift (‚àí60¬∞)
Create `y2` shifted by $-60^\circ$:
- **Method A:** `chirp(..., phi=-60)` (degrees).
- **Method B:** analytic rotation:

$$
y_2(t)=\Re\{\, y_a(t) \, e^{j\phi} \,\}, \qquad \phi=-60^\circ \ \text{(use radians in code)}.
$$

Estimate the phase difference using  
$\Delta\phi = -\arg\!\left( \sum_{t} \frac{ y_a(t)\,\overline{y_{2a}(t)} }{ \lvert y_{2a}(t)\rvert^{2} } \right)$

where $y_a$ and $y_{2a}$ are analytic signals of `y` and `y2`. Compare both methods.

### 3.2 Time-Varying Phase Shift ‚è±Ô∏è
Create `y3` by multiplying the analytic signal by $e^{-j 2\pi t}$ and taking the real part:

$$
y_3(t)=\{Re}{(y_a(t))\ e^{-j 2\pi t} \}.
$$
- Compute the **average** phase shift with the previous estimator and comment on its meaning for a ramp phase.
- Then estimate the **instantaneous** phase:

$$
\phi(t) \=\ \arg\frac{y_a(t)\,\overline{y_{3a}(t)}}{|y_{3a}(t)|^2})
$$

unwrap $\phi(t)$ and compare with the imposed law $\phi_{\text{true}}(t) = 2\pi t$.

## 4. Envelope in dB & Damping Estimate üßØ

For a damped response $y(t)=A\,e^{-\lambda t}\cos(\omega t-\phi)$ with time constant $\tau=1/\lambda$:
1) Compute the envelope $A(t)=|y_a(t)|$ and its **dB** scale (0 dB at the peak):  
$A_{\mathrm{dB}}(t)=20\log_{10}\Big(A(t)\Big)$
2) Fit a straight line to $A_{\mathrm{dB}}(t)$; read $\tau$ from the $-8.7\,\mathrm{dB}$ drop (i.e., $e^{-1}$).  
3) Estimate the damping ratio $\zeta$ using $\tau=\dfrac{1}{\zeta\,\omega_n}$ and compare with the theoretical value.
